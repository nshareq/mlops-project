# MWC-Module-3-Modular-Workflow-and-Project-Setup-Basics

## Problem Statement:

### Business Context:
The project aims to develop a machine learning system that predicts individual income levels based on demographic and employment data.

The prediction boundary is set at $50,000 annually (binary classification problem). The solution will help in understanding socio-economic factors affecting income levels.

### Objectives:
1. Enable data-driven decision-making for policymakers and financial institutions.
2. Identify key socio-economic factors influencing income disparities.
3. Support targeted intervention programs for economic development.

## Key Stakeholders:
- **Policy Makers**: For evidence-based policy development.
- **Financial Institutions**: For risk assessment and product development.
- **Social Services**: For resource allocation and program planning.
- **Research Organizations**: For socio-economic studies.

## Dataset Details:
Let's visualize the data structure and features:
